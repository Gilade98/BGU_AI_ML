It extracts device serial numbers and LifetimeIDs from connection events (2003) paired with disconnections (2100). This allows for automated analysis of connection/disconnection patterns, reducing the need for manual monitoring. **Detection Logic**: The Sigma rule uses ELK stack's Query DSL format to create filters that identify suspicious USB activity by extracting event data fields like device serial numbers and LifetimeIDs.

It covers topics such as: * General Issues: If the Microsoft Store for Desktop does not appear in the Start menu, try checking if the app package is properly installed. If the issue persists, check the Event Viewer logs to see if there are any errors related to the Microsoft Store for Desktop. Try resetting the Microsoft Store for Desktop by running the command `wsreset.exe` from an elevated Command Prompt. * Deployment Issues: App Package Installation Fails with Error 0x80073cf6 If your app package installation fails with error code 0x80073cf6, it may be due to a corrupted app package or incorrect manifest settings. Check the following: Verify that the app package is not damaged or corrupted. Ensure that the manifest file has the correct permissions and attributes set for the required files and folders. If the issue persists, try reinstalling the app package with administrator privileges. * User Interface Issues: Microsoft Store for Desktop Not Displaying App Content If the Microsoft Store for Desktop is not displaying any app content, try the following: Ensure that you have sufficient disk space available to run the Microsoft Store for Desktop. Check if the Microsoft Store for Desktop has been configured correctly with the required permissions and attributes set for the required files and folders. If the issue persists, try resetting the Microsoft Store for Desktop by running the command `wsreset.exe` from an elevated Command Prompt. * Advanced Troubleshooting Steps: Debugging App Package Installation Issues If you are experiencing issues with app package installation, you can use the following tools and techniques to debug the problem: Use the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) to analyze the system performance during app package installation. Enable the Windows Error Reporting feature to collect detailed error information for debugging purposes. If necessary, create a bootable Windows recovery environment using a USB drive and use it to troubleshoot the issue. * Additional Resources: Microsoft Support and Community Forums For additional support and resources on troubleshooting app package installation issues, visit the following links: [Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/) [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home?forum=wsl) [Microsoft App Center Forum](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/topics/win10-appcenter) * Related Topics: Windows 10 App Package Deployment Guide This guide provides a comprehensive overview of deploying app packages in Windows 10.
